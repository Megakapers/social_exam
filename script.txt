We are going to have a look at pedestrian data from Melbourne.

We will look at where people are at different hours of the day.

See if we can find oddities in the data that might suggest that something
extraordinary went on at at a given date and time.

See if we can identify specific dates, or find patterns in the pedestrian's
whereabouts through out the day.

To do this we need data!

The data we have tells gives us an hourly pedrestrian count from fourty three
sensors througout Melbourne.

We have data from May 2009

To Feburary 2016.

Every sensor is sampled once pr hour, this gives us a total of 1,421,849 rows of
data to analyze.

Let's have a look...

These are the locations of the 43 sensors:
