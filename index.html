                <p>It revolves around pedrestian data from Melbourn and it gives us a window into where pedestrians are throughout the day. The two tables consist of information about a number of sensors and a number of obervations. Today there is 44 sensors across Melbourne. The first sensors were installed in 2009 and since then more have been added.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each sensor is able to determine the number of pedestrians in it's proximity, every hour each sensor is sampled, giving us a total of almost 1.4 million rows to analyze. Each row contains information about the longitude and latitude of the sensor, which sensor it is, the date and time of the observation aand an hourly count amongst a few lesser interesting metrics.
                </p>

                <h3 class="ui header">A closer look at the data!</h3>
                <p> Below is an image showing the locations of the sensors throughout Melbourne just to get an idea about what we're looking at.</p>

                <p>
                    And here is another image this time we're focusing on the number of pedestirans observed by the different sensors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Curiously enough some of the sensors always senses people nearby, this can be seen in the bar chart showing the minimum houry count. Whether this is actually how it is we cannot say, however it seems unlikely that there are at least 35 people by sensor 38.
